<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

With the rise of ChatGPT, which uses LLM (Large Language Model) as the backbone, it opens up many new opportunities for innovation. 

However, there are problems when we use commercial models like ChatGPT, particularly concerning privacy. When we use ChatGPT, it means we are willing to share our data for use by the platform. If it's not sensitive information, then it's okay. But what if it is?

Another problem is the source of information that ChatGPT uses to answer your questions. We don't know if the answer is based on a reliable or credible source or not.

So here open-source LLMs come in with the power to deploy your own LLMs on your local machine or server. Also, we can utilizing our database as the contextual source to enable the models to provide answers based on the content within the database, so we can make sure the answer really comes from the source we want.

I've created an application that employs an open-source Large Language Model (LLM). This LLM is stored on your local machine and utilizes your database as its knowledge base or primary source of information to perform question-answering tasks.
